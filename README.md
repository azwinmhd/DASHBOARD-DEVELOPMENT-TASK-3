Description of Task:
A Power BI dashboard is a single-page visual representation of key performance indicators (KPIs) and other important metrics derived from underlying
reports and datasets. It provides a high-level overview of critical information, enabling users to quickly monitor performance, identify trends,
and make informed decisions. I have took the employee dataset for analysis. In this dashboard we can see and interact by just clicking the graphs created,
it will change accordingly. Power BI contains various set of visualizations to monitor the dataset. Some of them are bar charts, line charts, funnels, maps,
pie chart etc. We can also do many alterations and apply various designs. It can make the report more attractive and simple. There is no coding needed for this tool, 
we can simply load the dataset, drag and drop the fields we want. It is very easy and interactive.

Benefits of using Power BI dashboards:
Real-time Monitoring: Track KPIs and metrics in real time to identify trends and potential issues.
Data-driven Decisions: Make informed decisions based on accurate and up-to-date data.
Improved Communication: Share insights and findings with stakeholders in a clear and concise manner.
Increased Efficiency: Quickly access critical information without having to navigate through multiple reports.

Key characteristics of a Power BI dashboard:
Single Page: Dashboards are limited to one page, ensuring that all critical information is visible at a glance.
Visualizations: Data is presented through various visualizations such as charts, graphs, maps, and gauges, making it easier to understand and interpret.
Tiles: Visualizations are displayed as tiles, which can be arranged and resized for optimal presentation.
Interactive: Users can interact with the dashboard by clicking on tiles to drill down into underlying reports for more detailed information.
Data Refresh: Dashboards are connected to live data sources, ensuring that the information is always up-to-date.
Mobile Access: Dashboards can be viewed on mobile devices, providing access to critical information anytime, anywhere.
